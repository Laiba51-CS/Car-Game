# Car-Game
I have successfully developed a captivating car game using the C# programming language, incorporating a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). Players are able to navigate the car by utilizing designated key inputs, specifically the left and right arrow keys to steer the vehicle accordingly. The game also incorporates a fuel consumption mechanic, wherein players must strategically collect fuel to increase the car's health. If the car's health reaches zero, the game concludes.

This project demonstrates a seamless fusion of technical proficiency in C# programming and meticulous graphical design, resulting in a refined and immersive gaming experience. Its visually stunning graphics and intuitive controls enhance the overall gameplay, providing players with an enjoyable and engaging experience.
